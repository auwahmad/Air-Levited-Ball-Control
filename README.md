# Air-Levitated-Ball-Control
Floating Ball Control Project with Arduino & MATLAB. Utilizing as in-class activities for engineering students in control course.

The project was aimed to explore system dynamics and control concepts. It started with SolidWorks model to design a 3D printed base for the support of the Blower Fan controlled by an Arduino UNO with a motor shield. To implement closed-loop control, Simulink model was created and PID parameters were manually adjusted for optimal performance, incorporating real-time position feedback from an Ultrasonic (HC-SR04) Sensor.
Additionally, Simulink Dashboard Items were used designed a user-friendly GUI to enhance system interaction and control. For data collection and analysis, an experimental MATLAB Live Script bench was created:
*initializing variables, defining parameters (such as gains and sample time), 
*configuring the plot environment, 
*running closed-loop simulations, and 
*preparing for system identification and validation using collected data.
This project highlights my comprehensive approach to system design, implementation, and analysis, demonstrating practical application of control systems principles through hands-on experimentation.
